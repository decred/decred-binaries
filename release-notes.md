# decrediton v1.2.1

This decrediton patch release covers a few commonly reported issues shortly
after v1.2.0 was released.  Most importantly this fixes an issue causing 
balances to show 0 after new blocks connect.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix an issue that was causing non-dirs to be discovered as valid legacy wallets.
  This would cause "config.json" incompletely setup wallet on first load of v1.2.0

* Fix balance showing 0 after ticket/votes calculated for maturity.  

* Seed pasting was not showing errors and would just blank out the words.  Now
  an error is shown when that occurs.

* Fix various PT-Br translation errors.

* Due to dcrd v1.2.0 database upgrade, users would be shown "Waiting for RPC..." 
  for a very long time with no other information.  Now the first lines of both
  dcrd and dcrwallet logs are shown to hopefully give the user more information
  about the current state of the daemon upgrade.

# dcrd v1.2.0

This release of dcrd contains significant performance enhancements,
infrastructure improvements, improved access to chain-related information for
providing better SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) support, and other
quality assurance changes.

A significant amount of infrastructure work has also been done this release
cycle towards being able to support several planned scalability optimizations.

## Downgrade Warning

The database format in v1.2.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the
software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous
versions will see a one time database migration.

Once this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to
downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the
database and redownload the chain.

## Notable Changes

### Significantly Faster Startup

The startup time has been improved by roughly 17x on slower hard disk drives
(HDDs) and 8x on solid state drives (SSDs).

In order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as
previously mentioned, that will likely take a while to complete (typically
around 5 to 6 minutes on HDDs and 2 to 3 minutes on SSDs).

### Support For DNS Seed Filtering

In order to better support the forthcoming SPV wallets, support for finding
other peers based upon their enabled services has been added.  This is useful
for both SPV wallets and full nodes since SPV wallets will require access to
full nodes in order to retrieve the necessary proofs and full nodes are
generally not interested in making outgoing connections to SPV wallets.

### Committed Filters

With the intention of supporting light clients, such as SPV wallets, in a
privacy-preserving way while still minimizing the amount of data that needs to
be downloaded, this release adds support for committed filters.  A committed
filter is a combination of a probalistic data structure that is used to test
whether an element is a member of a set with a predetermined collision
probability along with a commitment by consensus-validating full nodes to that
data.

A committed filter is created for every block which allows light clients to
download the filters and match against them locally rather than uploading
personal data to other nodes.

A new service flag is also provided to allow clients to discover nodes that
provide access to filters.

There is a one time database update to build and store the filters for all
existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically
around 2 to 3 minutes on HDDs and 1 to 1.5 minutes on SSDs).

### Updated Atomic Swap Contracts

The standard checks for atomic swap contracts have been updated to ensure the
contracts enforce the secret size for safer support between chains with
disparate script rules.

### RPC Server Changes

#### New `getchaintips` RPC

A new RPC named `getchaintips` has been added which allows callers to query
information about the status of known side chains and their branch lengths.
It currently only provides support for side chains that have been seen while the
current instance of the process is running.  This will be further improved in
future releases.

# dcrwallet 1.2.0

This release provides bug fixes for issues reported by users as well as new RPC
features and additions which are required for Decrediton and Politeia.  SPV work
is ongoing but these changes will not land until a future release and after most
of the network nodes are running with committed filter support.

This release contains a database upgrade and once upgraded it is not possible
to downgrade to previous wallet releases without performing a seed restore with
the old version.

## Bug fixes

* Orphan votes (votes which have become invalid for the new main chain tip block
  after a reorg or missed vote) are now rejected from reentering the wallet if
  still notified by dcrd.

* Watching only wallets are now usable again, after a breaking change to them
  introduced in the 1.1.2 release.

* The transaction fee when purchasing tickets with the `purchaseticket` JSON-RPC
  and `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` gRPC methods will now fallback to the
  wallet's configured fee rate if not specified by the RPC request.

* Various gRPC methods which allowed specifying 0 DCR as a target amount (e.g.
  `WalletService.FundTransaction`) now follow their documentation and will
  return or use as many unspent outputs as possible.

* Outputs of transactions with an expiry set are not spendable by consensus
  rules until having reached coinbase maturity.  These outputs are no longer
  returned or used when selecting previous outputs to create new transactions.

## New features

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.UnspentOutputs` has been added to return a
  stream of all wallet unspent outputs.  Outputs may be filtered by their
  associated account and required confirmations, as well as stopping once a
  total target amount has been reached or exceeded.

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.BestBlock` has been added which will return
  the hash and height of the current main chain tip block.  Previously, this
  information was only available as a unary RPC with the
  `WalletService.Accounts` method.

* The gRPC method `WalletService.GetTickets` will paginate results if called
  with a new target ticket count parameter.

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.CommittedTickets` has been added to find
  ticket purchase hashes specified by the request where the largest P2PKH
  commitment amount is controlled by the wallet.  The commitment address is
  additionally returned by the result.

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SignMessages` has been added to sign multiple
  messages at a time without needing to unlock and lock the wallet before and
  after each call.

* The gRPC `BlockDetails` and `BlockInfoResponse` messages now include a new
  field which specifies whether votes in the block disapprove of the parent
  block.

* A new JSON-RPC method `publishunminedtransactions` has been added which
  resends all unmined transactions of the wallet.

* A new JSON-RPC method `sweepaccount` has been added which can be used to move
  as much value as possible from an account to either (possibly the same)
  account or an address.  This RPC can be used in place of the `consolidate`
  method but without knowing and specifying exactly how many inputs to use.

* The new JSON-RPC methods `startautobuyer` and `stopautobuyer` have been added
  which can start and stop the automatic ticket purchaser over JSON-RPC, similar
  to the already existing `StartAutoBuyer` and `StopAutoBuyer` gRPC methods of
  the `TicketBuyerService`.

* The JSON-RPC method `getbalance` now returns aggregate balances for all
  accounts if called with the special `*` account name.

## Other improvements

* The sendtosstx, sendtossgen, and sendtossrtx JSON-RPC methods have been
  removed.  These RPCs were intended to manually send ticket purchases, votes,
  and revocations manually, but were unimplemented and would cause crashes if
  used.

* Transaction size estimation has been improved to more accurately estimate
  fees, in particular when redeeming with pay-to-script-hash redeem scripts.

* The `help` JSON-RPC method text for the `getbalance` RPC has been updated to
  reflect the changes made to the returned object.

* Users are now informed with log messages to configure their public passphrase
  or enter it on startup if the wallet is encrypted with one but it was not
  specified.

* Script execution errors during sanity checks after signing inputs now record
  additional information about the failure including the previous output and
  script being spent and the signature script used by the input.

# decrediton 1.2.0

This release of decrediton adds some major changes to the wallet startup,
overview page and adds the first round of statistics for better user
information.  Now that the overall look and feel designed by Eeter has been
impletmented we will be focusing on refinement and adding improved
responsiveness (eg dark mode, resolving to various media widths).

Launcher has been redesigned to provide the user with a more intuitive startup
experience.  In normal working mode, the daemon (of the chosen network) will
begin to sync and become operational while the user completes wallet
creation/selection.  Then once both the wallet is ready and the daemon has
synced the wallet will fully load.

A tutorial, release notes, settings and logs have all been added to the
launcher for the user to utilize whilst they may be waiting for their daemon
to sync.  Hopefully this will allow the user to more seamlessly create wallets
with less confusion or require any additional support.

The wallet creation by seed has received a substantial update as well.  We now
allow the user to copy seeds (if they complete a warning screen) and also paste
seeds.  And for confirmation for new wallets only requires the user to complete
1/3 of the words to confirm storage of wallet's seed.

Overview has beed redesigned to give the user more information about their
wallet's current situation and to guide them where to find various features
of their wallet.  Basic graphs covering balances, tickets and transactions have
been added.  All recent transactions and recent ticket activity can be found
below the overview graphs.  We will be adding more features to the overview page
as we gauge user interest and feedback on existing additions.

Introductory data prepartion and statistics have been implemented for this
release.  For now we are providing a small window of lookback for transactions,
staking and other information.  The reduced window size is mostly an issue
with unsatisfactory performance.  When this performance improves, we will be
adding custom windows and window lengths for custom graphing and exporting
options.

## New Features


* Validate Addresses - a form to validate addresses has been added to the
  Security Center.  This will allow users to test addresses to confirm address
  ownership and/or validity.

* Filter by address - now transactions can be filtered by address in History.
  When the user enters a string into the address filter form, it will show any
  address that has an output with a matching address.

* Charts - we have decided to use [recharts](https://recharts.org) as our first
  charting solution.

* Import wallet from hex seed - instead of entering in the 33 word
  mnemonic, they are now able to use the hex representation of their seed.

* Export data to CSV - we now all users to export various types of data to csv.
  These options are found under the Transactions page.

* Show logs - logs can now be found on the launcher and on the help page.
  For now, we only show the logs of the current instance of wallet and daemon.
  This is mostly due to performance with pulling in thousands of lines of text.

# decrediton v1.1.3

This decrediton patch release covers a few commonly reported issues shortly
after v1.1.2 was released.  Most importantly this fixes a random issue on
the Windows version that was causing an unavoidable crash on startup.

## Bug Fixes

* Rollback electron-store/conf version to avoid asar/json Windows issue.

* Remove "Revoke tickets..." alert from Overview.  Due to a deeper issue in
  dcrwallet the notification whether there are tickets to revoke is being
  incorrectly announced.  Until that fix is available, it seems better to avoid
  showing the alert which confuses the user.

* Fix errors on adding Stakepool API.  On failed Stakepool API requests, the
  Stakey bounce animation would remain and the user would be unable to proceed.

* Fix sorting of voted/revoked tickets in My Tickets.

* Fix Account Key display

* Fix issue with using "Enter" to complete any Get Started form.  Doing so
  would previously make Decrediton shut down instead of submitting the action.

* Hide Paginator when <= 1 page

# dcrd v1.1.2

This release of dcrd primarily contains performance enhancements, infrastructure
improvements, and other quality assurance changes.

While it is not visible in this release, significant infrastructure work has
also been done this release cycle towards porting the Lightning Network (LN)
daemon which will ultimately allow LN payments to be backed by Decred.

## Notable Changes

### Faster Block Validation

A significant portion of block validation involves handling the stake tickets
which form an integral part of Decred's hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake
system.  The code which handles this portion of validation has been
significantly optimized in this release such that overall block validation is
up to approximately 3 times faster depending on the specific underlying hardware
configuration.  This also has a noticeable impact on the speed of the initial
block download process as well as how quickly votes for winning tickets are
submitted to the network.

### Data Carrier Transaction Standardness Policy

The standard policy for transaction relay of data carrier transaction outputs
has been modified to support canonically-encoded small data pushes.  These
outputs are also known as `OP_RETURN` or `nulldata` outputs.  In particular,
single byte small integers data pushes (0-16) are now supported.

# dcrwallet v1.1.2

This release focuses on internal improvements to the wallet to increase code
quality, thereby making it easier to add optional support for SPV syncing in a
future release.  As always, it also comes with bug fixes, new features and other
improvements, which are detailed below.

### Bug fixes

* Vote transactions that become invalid when the main chain tip block changes
  are now removed from the wallet.  This allows the invalid vote to be double
  spent by another vote later if the ticket is picked again on a different
  chain.

* Ticket buyer now attempts to avoid purchasing tickets for old blocks if it is
  enabled while the wallet is catching up to the network.

* The application now exits cleanly if an interrupt signal (e.g. ^C or SIGINT)
  is received while at a prompt (such as during wallet creation, or with
  `--promptpass`) instead of hanging at the prompt.

* The application no longer refuses to start when duplicate RPC listener
  addresses which bind to port 0 are specified in the config.

* The `listtransactions` JSON-RPC has been fixed so that the order and amount
  values of all results match the results returned by Bitcoin Core.

* The `gettransaction` JSON-RPC has been fixed to return fees as negative
  numbers instead of positive, which matches the behavior of Bitcoin Core.

### New features

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTickets` has been introduced to return all
  wallet ticket purchases between a block range.  The results are streamed to
  the client.

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` has been added with similar
  semantics and usage to the `validateaddress` JSON-RPC method.  It can be used
  to decode an address string, ensuring that it is a valid address, as well as
  returning whether the address is owned by the wallet.

* A new gRPC service `DecodeMessageService` has been introduced to make it
  easier for clients not able to decode raw Decred wire messages themselves to
  decode a message into a gRPC message.  Currently, one method exists in the
  service, `DecodeRawTransaction`, which decodes a Decred transaction.

* Pagination support has been added to the `WalletService.GetTransactions`
  method through the introduction of a new `target_transaction_count` parameter
  in the request.  Responses are immediately streamed to the client when the
  target is reached.

* The TX IPC pipe has been added (enabled with the `pipetx` option) to receive
  messages from the application by a parent process.  When combined with the
  `rpclistenerevents` option, this allows the application to inform the parent
  process of the listener addresses used by the gRPC and JSON-RPC servers.  This
  is especially useful when binding listeners to port 0 as the application is
  able to report the actual port chosen by the operating system to the parent
  process.

### Other improvements

* Vendoring management of dependency source code has been switched from `glide`
  to `dep`.  See the README.md for new build instructions.

* The BIP0044 coin type has been seamlessly upgraded from the old Decred value
  of 20 to 42.  The new coin type is the coin type reserved for Decred in
  [SLIP0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) and
  will allow greater compatibility with third party wallets.  New wallets are
  always created with the new coin type, but for legacy compatibility old
  wallets and seed restores which have address usage with the old coin type will
  not be upgraded.

* The address discovery algorithm has been made more concurrent and should see
  performance improvements, especially on CPUs with high core counts.

* Performance improvements were made to the `WalletService.GetTransactions` gRPC
  method by avoiding unnecessary JSON-RPC calls to dcrd.

* The `ticketaddress` option has been deprecated and replaced by the
  `ticketbuyer.votingaddress` option.

* Publishing duplicate vote transactions in a redundant voting wallet setup no
  longer logs an error for a rejected duplicate transaction.

# decrediton v1.1.2

This release marks a major turning point in our overall look and feel of
Decrediton. We have introduced consistent header areas with a new subpage/tab
interface.  React-motion has been added to give a better feel for transitions
from page to page and expanded area reveals.  All information modals and
passphrase modals have been consolidated to have a consistent feel whenever they
are used.

As part of the design overhaul, the Tickets page has begun its transformation
to provide a much better user experience.  My Tickets subpage is the first step
into giving users a clearer picture into their current staking situation.  In
the upcoming release, we will be adding extensive statistics and graphing to
further help visualize a given users' balance and staking history.  Overall,
we aim to continue to add more tools that will help users' staking experience
be much more enjoyable and carefree.

We have also added advanced daemon setup abilities for users that want to use
remote daemons or use a different location for their blockchain data.  In the
next release, we plan on also adding the ability to handle advanced back-end
wallet setups: easily switch between different wallet files on the same machine,
connecting to a remote wallet and other possible situations.  But these advanced
options will also be completely transparent for users that choose to run with
the default settings.

We have added a Security Center page that will be a catch-all place to
store tools that we feel have utility, but aren't needed for everyday normal
wallet operation.  The first 2 tools that have been added are for Signing and
Verifying messages using addresses and private keys to prove ownership of a
given address.  Here is a typical use case:  User A wants to prove to User B
that they control a given address.  With the Sign Message tool, User A enters
the address, a message and their wallet's private passphrase.  The tool produces
a hash that was created based on that address' private key and the given
message.  With the Verify Message tool, User B can use the address in question,
the hash and the message from User A to verify that it was signed using that
address' private key.

We are also happy to announce the introduction of internationalization.
Brazilian Portuguese has been added for the first pass and we will be slowly
adding more languages on every new release.

Things to expect in the next release:

- New overview page design
- Rich historical Statistics/Graphs
- New staking account user experience
- Advanced wallet settings
- More languages translated

## Bug fixes

* Fix issue on Windows caused by using "Aux" as a filename.  Aux is a restricted
  filename with Windows and a simple filename change fixed it.

* Fix shutdown issue with macOS.  When cmd-Q or quitting Decrediton from the
  dock caused dcrd and dcrwallet to not be shutdown in the background.  By
  adding a final closeClis() in app.on("before-quit",...) it ensures that
  everything is closed on any shutdown.

* Removed Skip Sync button due to the new slip44 change in dcrwallet.  With the
  new coin type change, dcrwallet needs to check if there has been any address
  usage up to that point in the chain for a given wallet.

* Shorten account names in various areas to avoid obnoxious overflow.

* Fix issue that was occuring when clearing out stakepool configurations.  This
  would cause users to possibly have incorrect stakepool setups.

* Change functionality of the space key during seed entry.  Previously, when the
  user would enter the space key they would end up not "selecting" a word and
  then just type the whole seed.  Now the space "selects" the word just as
  pressing tab does.

# decrediton v1.1.1

This patch release primarily fixes Windows version from not allowing dcrd and
dcrwallet to be shutdown gracefully.  Upon decrediton close, shutdown requests
are given to the 2 child-processes to cleanly shutdown now.

This commit also marks the first unit test of the React components we are
including.   In the upcoming releases we plan on expanding test coverage to
hopefully ensure that each release is as bug free as possible.

We can now get transaction details for pending transactions and the
transaction notifactions are clickable to see that details page.

App versions are now pulled directly from the binaries themselves instead
of any hardcoding so users can be assured they are running specific versions
of dcrd and dcrwallet underneath.

## Bug Fixes

- Disable rescan, add ApiKey and Import Script buttons if there is an
  outstanding rescan request processing.  Otherwise you can issue multiple
  requests at the same time and it will lead to unsightly UX.

- Fix Stakepools Overview link that was resulting in a 404 previously.

- Add total subsidy to the tickets page.

- Fix Add Stakepool Button in Stakepool Config page.

# dcrd v1.1.0

This release of dcrd primarily introduces a new consensus vote agenda which
allows the stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate the features needed
for providing full support for Lightning Network.  For those unfamiliar with the
voting process in Decred, this means that all code in order to support these
features is already included in this release, however its enforcement will
remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.

The following Decred Change Proposals (DCPs) describe the proposed changes in detail:
- [DCP0002](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki)
- DCP0003 (This documentation is not complete yet.  It will be available soon after release and before the vote begins)

It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release
even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.

## Notable Changes

### Lightning Network Features Vote

In order to fully support many of the benefits that the Lightning Network will
bring, there are some primitives that involve changes to the current consensus
that need to be enabled.  A new vote with the id "lnfeatures" is now available
as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences
through their wallet or stake pool's website.

### Transaction Finality Policy

The standard policy for transaction relay has been changed to use the median
time of the past several blocks instead of the current network adjusted time
when examining lock times to determine if a transaction is final.  This provides
a more deterministic check across all peers and prevents the possibility of
miners attempting to game the timestamps in order to include more transactions.

Consensus enforcement of this change relies on the result of the aforementioned
'lnfeatures' vote.

### Relative Time Locks Policy

The standard policy for transaction relay has been modified to enforce relative
lock times for version 2 transactions via their sequence numbers and a new
`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` opcode.

Consensus enforcement of this change relies on the result of the aforementioned
'lnfeatures' vote.

### OP_SHA256 Opcode

In order to better support cross-chain interoperability, a new opcode to compute
the SHA-256 hash is being proposed.  Since this opcode is implemented as a hard
fork, it will not be available for use in scripts unless the aforementioned
'lnfeatures' vote passes.

# dcrwallet v1.1.0

This release focuses on adding voting agendas for the hard forks described in
[DCP0002](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki) and [DCP0003]().  It also comes with the normal set of bug fixes and
improvements.

## Bug fixes

* Revocations can now be created which double spend an unmined vote, as long as
  the vote is not voting on the most recent block.  This allows revocations to
  be created for votes that were made but not included in the block by miners.

* Tickets manually added through the `addticket` JSON-RPC method are now
  included in the `gettickets` results.  This is required for correct stakepool
  functionality.

* An off-by-one was fixed when logging the number of watched addresses at wallet
  startup.

* A divide-by-zero error has been fixed when attempting to use the integrated
  ticket buyer starting from the genesis block on simnet.

## New features

* A new gRPC method `WalletService.CreateSignature` has been added to create a
  raw transaction input signature.  This is useful for clients that need to
  include signatures in non-standard scripts without resorting to dumping a
  private key and signing in the client.

* The gRPC `WalletService.Balance` result has been updated to include the
  unconfirmed balance.  This unconfirmed balance has the same semantics as the
  unconfirmed field from the `getbalance` JSON-RPC result.

## Other improvements

* The help text for the `addticket` JSON-RPC method has been updated to reflect
  that fact that manually added tickets are not reported in the statistics
  returned by the `getstakeinfo` method.

* Added support for Go 1.9.  Release binaries are now created using this Go
  version.

* The sample config has been updated for the current configuration defaults.
  This sample config had not been updated in the past when default config
  options were changed.

# decrediton v1.1.0

This release decrediton is significant for a few newly added features and
improvements.  With the help of jrick, we are now able to control child
processes properly in Windows and are now able to add Windows support.

The entire startup process has been refined to help users understand what is
happening behind the scenes.  Now it should be clear to users when the
blockchain is downloading and what the consequences are for skipping initial
sync.

We have also completed work on the initial phases of the React/Redux refactor.
All inline styles have been replaced with Less styling and all components
have been broken up into logic and presentation portions.  The next step will
be to audit and refactor the Redux state and ensure that everything is
immutable and recording proper state.

The following release will include a completely redesigned UX for staking.  We
hope that this will make staking more approachable to new users.  We will also
be adding complete ticket status information and basic graphs for users to
visualize their accumulated returns from staking.

## New Features

* An "About" window now shows current decrediton version, plus versions of
  packaged dcrd and dcrwallet binaries. This should help debug users' issues
  going forward.

* New startup procedure.  We now wait for dcrd's rpc connection to be available
  and subsequently check block count.  We can now show users an estimated time
  for full blockchain download.  This done by using a best guess according to
  5 minutes per block and when the chain launched.  We plan on using more
  intelligent methods of checking current block height in the future.

* Send all.  Users can now construct transactions that will completely drain an
  account.  Simply select the account you would like to send from, click "Send
  All" then enter you destination address.  You will then be shown the
  amount to be sent and the estimated fee.  Click send and enter your
  private passphrase to complete the transaction.

* Show rescan progress in sidebar.  This should help users avoid confusion
  after linking ApiKeys or importing scripts.

* Allow for basic resizing of the application window.  We are currently
  designing fully implemented media size break points.  But in the meantime
  this fix should allow users with low PPI screens to see the entire
  application view.

## Bug fixes

* Clear stakepool configurations when creating a new wallet.  Otherwise, users
  could get into unintended situations with stakepool settings from one wallet
  being attempted on another.  Other checks were still in place to avoid major
  issues, but this led to undesirable UX.

* Show pending transactions of all types in the overview and the history page.

* Fix erroneous reloads and form submission in get started pages.

* Settings were being saved on field change instead of Save Setting submit.

* When using testnet, use different background color in SideBar to accentuate
  that is is a different network.

# Paymetheus v1.1.0

This release is likely to be the last, or one of the last, Paymetheus releases.
We have decided to unifiy efforts into development of our cross-platform GUI,
decrediton.  We will continue to search for interested WPF/xaml developers
that would like to continue development of this native Windows GUI. Users are
encouraged to migrate to the Windows release of Decrediton by importing your
Paymetheus seed.  In the meantime, this release of Paymetheus contains the
updates for voting on DCP0002 and DCP0003 and is intended as an interim release
to smooth the migration process.

# dcrwallet v1.0.8

This release focused on minor bug fixes.  No new features have been added.

## Bug fixes

* Tickets that are not owned by the wallet but are still recorded for spend
  tracking purposes are skipped when generating the stake information and acting
  on selected ticket notifications.  This prevents misreporting a high missed
  count in the stake information and avoids trying to create and send unsigned
  votes or revocations for tickets that can't be spent by the wallet.

* gRPC transaction notifications for mined transactions now use the earliest of
  the seen time and block time as their timestamp.  This prevents seed-restored
  wallets from using the time of restore as the transaction time as well as
  using the block time for any transactions received while the wallet was
  offline.

* gRPC services are no longer registered with the server after it has begun
  serving and listening for clients.  This is a correctness fix for a data race
  and a misuse of the gRPC package.  Delayed services such as the WalletService
  still require a loaded wallet to be used and users of the API shouldn't notice
  any difference.

## Paymetheus v1.0.8

This release focused on under-the-hood improvements to the backend (dcrwallet)
instead of new features or UI changes.

## Bug fixes

* Mined transactions now use the earliest of the seen time and the block time
  for a timestamp.  This avoids simply showing every transaction arriving at the
  time of restore when a wallet is seed restored, and also corrects the
  timestamp for transactions received while the wallet was not running.

## decrediton v1.0.8

This patch release fixes a critical bug that effected users that had multiple
stakepools configured at the same time.  Periodically some stakepool settings
would get overwritten onto others which would cause pool fees to be incorrectly
set for a given ticket.  If the pool fees were too low according to the stakepool,
they would be considered invalid.  If you believe you could have been effected
by this issue, please check on your stakepool tickets page to see if you have
any invalid tickets.  Then please contact your stakepool operator about getting
the tickets added and ready to be voted on.

Upon upgrading to 1.0.8 it is recommended to delete your existing config.json
located in your decrediton application directory.  Then restart your decrediton
and re-enter your apikeys.  You may need to restart decrediton an extra time
for your stakepool list to populate.

## dcrd v1.0.7

This release of dcrd primarily contains improvements to the infrastructure and other quality assurance changes
that are bringing us closer to providing full support for Lightning Network.

A lot of work required for Lightning Network support went into getting the required code merged into the upstream
project, btcd, which now fully supports it.  These changes also must be synced and integrated with dcrd as well and
therefore many of the changes in this release are related to that process.


## Notable Changes

### Dust check removed from stake transactions

The standard policy for regular transactions is to reject any transactions that have outputs so small that
they cost more to the network than their value.  This behavior is desirable for regular transactions, however
it was also being applied to vote and revocation transactions which could lead to a situation where stake pools
with low fees could result in votes and revocations having difficulty being mined.

This check has been changed to only apply to regular transactions now in order to prevent any issues.  Stake
transactions have several other checks that make this one unnecessary for them.

### New `feefilter` peer-to-peer message

A new optional peer-to-peer message named `feefilter` has been added that allows peers to inform others about the
minimum transaction fee rate they are willing to accept.  This will enable peers to avoid notifying others about
transactions they will not accept anyways and therefore can result in a significant bandwith savings.

### Bloom filter service bit enforcement

Peers that are configured to disable bloom filter support will now disconnect remote peers that send bloom
filter related commands rather than simply ignoring them.  This allows any light clients that do not observe
the service bit to potentially find another peer that provides the service.  Additionally, remote peers that
have negotiated a high enough protocol version to observe the service bit and still send bloom filter
related commands anyways will now be banned.

## dcrwallet v1.0.7

This release focused on fixing several issues related to corrupted spend
tracking that would cause double spend errors when sending transactions.  All
users are recommended to upgrade.

This release also lays the groundwork for more staking features to be
implemented in future releases.  The wallet now tracks more details about all
tickets and the votes or revocations that spend them.  In future releases, this
can be used to implement highly requested features such as detailed listings of
all tickets, votes, and revocations and subsidy calculations.

### Database upgrade notice

This release contains a wallet database upgrade.  Once upgraded, the database
can not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from
seed or backup.  The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your
wallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.

### Bug fixes

* Gaps are no longer created between watched addresses.  This in turn fixes
  issues where incoming transactions were not received by the wallet and
  subsequently fixes various double spending and orphan transaction errors when
  sending transactions or purchasing tickets.  Users affected by these issues
  are asked to rescan or restore from seed after upgrading.

* Adding multiple double spending unconfirmed transactions to the wallet no
  longer corrupts spend tracking.
 
* Database usage has been altered to avoid known data corruption issues caused
  by Bolt cursors.
 
* Wrapped address child indexes now continue to stay wrapped across wallet
  restarts instead of returning to the highest returned child index.  This may
  avoid unintended address reuse issues.
 
* The first address of newly-created accounts is no longer skipped over when
  generating addresses.
 
* Handling of stake transactions has been rewritten to keep data consistent with
  missed votes and blockchain reorganizations.
 
* Balance reporting has been corrected for the voting authority and locked by
  tickets balances by taking the ticket purchase's transaction fee into account.
 
* The `sendtoaddress`, `sendfrom`, and `sendmany` JSON-RPC methods now verify
  that the intended network of addresses in the request match the active
  network.
 
* Missing an explicitly specified config file now errors instead of only logging
  a warning.
 
### New features
 
* The `signrawtransaction` JSON-RPC and `WalletService.SignTransaction` gRPC
  methods are now capable of being used on offline wallets.
 
* The `WalletService.SignMessage` and `MessageVerificationService.VerifyMessage`
  gRPC methods have been introduced to add message signing and verification
  features to the gRPC API.  These methods operate similarly to the
  `signmessage` and `verifymessage` JSON-RPC methods.
 
* The `getbalance` JSON-RPC method now includes fields for unconfirmed balances
  of each account.  These balances are calculated as the spendable (by
  consensus) balance which is not already included under the `spendable` field,
  which is the spendable balance by both consensus rules and the minimum number
  of required confirmations.  The addition of both fields equals the total
  spendable-by-consensus balance.
 
* Private passphrases can now be specified on the command line or in a config
  file with the `--pass` option.  When used, the passphrase prompt at startup is
  avoided when the auto ticket buyer is enabled.
 
### Other improvements
 
* The auto ticket buyer takes better advantage of the improved ticket price
  algorithm by reducing the default maximum ticket purchase fee from 0.1/kB to
  0.01/kB and reducing the maximum number of tickets purchased per block from 5
  to 1.
 
* Ticket purchases are now removed from the wallet once the ticket price
  changes. As a result, the `--prunetickets` config option is no longer required
  or useful and has been deprecated.
 
* Performance enhancements have been made for the `getstakeinfo` JSON-RPC and
  `WalletService.StakeInfo` gRPC methods.
 
* The logger has been rewritten for improved performance.  Rolled log files are
  now gzipped.
 
* Error logs for duplicate script imports when the wallet is locked have been
  removed.
 
* Code quality has improved over several areas.

All commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.5...v1.0.7).
 
 
## Paymetheus v1.0.7
 
This release focused on under-the-hood improvements to the backend (dcrwallet)
instead of new features or UI changes.  Users should no longer encounter double
spend or orphan transaction errors sending transactions due to fixes for wallet
spend tracking corruption, but a seed restore is necessary to fix
already-corrupted wallets.

### Database upgrade notice
 
This release contains a wallet database upgrade.  Once upgraded, the database
can not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from
seed or backup.  The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your
wallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.

### Other improvements
 
* Performance enhancements have been made for querying stake statistics in the
  "Stake mining" view.

## decrediton v1.0.7
 
This release of decrediton aims to smooth out various issues that users have
consistently reported since the release of v1.0.6.  Extra care has been taken
to ensure that users get as much information as possible to understand some
of the innerworks of Decred.  But at the same time, ticket purchasing and other
features are actively being simplified and refined.  We have also added
some basic animations instead of the default loading screens.  We hope to
integrate several pieces of art and animations from our amazing community of 
artists.

In the coming releases we are expecting the following: Windows releases and
a completely revamped onboarding procedure.  This release is a step toward
realizng those goals.

We have also begun a complete refactor and reorganization of the React 
components.  This [issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/528) describes the end goal of this project.
Ideally, we will be able to make the UX/UI development open to all designers,
which will allow for a true collborative effort.

* The first address of newly-created accounts is no longer skipped over when
  generating addresses.
 
* Handling of stake transactions has been rewritten to keep data consistent with
  missed votes and blockchain reorganizations.
 
* Ticket autobuyer was not properly starting and stopping. Now user is
  properly notified when the ticket buyer has started. In the coming releases,
  we will be adding even more feedback from ticket buyer so the the user
  is able to see some of the decision making happening each block.

* Autobuyer settings are now properly set on config updates and have confirmed
  that dcrwallet receives all settings as expected configuration changes.

* Under strange circumstances, users with multiple stakepools reported that
  settings were being overwritten. Now, only the pool fees field is updated if
  necessary.

* Revocations are now shown in the transaction History page.

* Small display fixes now allow clear rendering on Windows.  We are in the
  process of fully releasing on Windows in the next release.
 
* Font files were previously configured incorrectly due to not have the
  corresponding font files for request font weight.  It made all fonts look
  fuzzy and unclear.
 
* Some fields have been fixed to allow expected double-click-to-select
  functionality. We are auditting and trying to fix all of them soon.
 
* Testnet2 Wallets weren't properly being located.
 
* Update to use current network minfees by default (0.001 DCR/kB).
 
* New account creation and account renaming are now shown immediately after
  successful response from wallet.  Previously it would take an extra render
  for them to be updated in the accounts list.
 
### New features:
 
* Transaction details page has been revamped to provide the used inputs and new
  outputs that each transaction creates. We will be adding more to this page
  as new information is added to be received from dcrwallet.
 
* Transaction notifications have been moved to the bottom of the screen and
  now contain a much clearer idea of each new transaction received.  We will
  be adding the ability to click on these notifications to show the full
  transaction details page.
 
* Implement new seed entry system (react-select).  Now users can use the
  bubble entry system to ensure they have proper spellings and length when
  entering existing seed or confirming new ones.
 
* We have started to add tooltips to various fields with the react-tooltip
  package.  We are trying to avoid putting tooltips on everything.  We mostly
  try to follow feedback we're getting from users as to where tooltips might
  clear up confusion in terms of the UX.
 
* Add copy-to-clipboard functionality to address generation on the Receive page.
  We're currently auditing other places that it would make sense to add these
  buttons (or some other trigger to copy).  Most likely, tx and block hashes,
  scripts and other long strings that are annoying to highlight to copy.
 
* Add logging with winston package.  This is the first step at revamping the
  startup procedure for decrediton.  The more instances where users are can
  see where something wrong, the better we can fix/diagnose further issues.
 
* Introduce custrom animations for loading times.  Currently we have a simple
  rotating DCR logo and a sprite animated Stakey.  We are planning on adding
  a few more from various artists to showcase some of the great art being
  created by our community.
 
### Other improvements:
 
* Add working wallet/account buttons to go to Accounts page for better UX.
 
* Move stakeinfo to an expandable div on tickets page.
 
* Overhaul of various styling according to designer input.
 
* Refactor redux actions for cleaner reading.
 
* Add better instructions for stakepool apikey entry.
 
* Begin complete react component/container refactor.  This is the first step
  towards fixing component structure and reuse.
 
* Begin removing inline styles and Radium, replaced with Less styling.
 
* Add config option to use a remote daemon set up.
 
* Update README.md to include quirk about installing decrediton for the first
  time for development.
 
* Add core-decorators library and utilize @autobind annotation.
 
* Update to use webpack 3.
 
* Add rpm and deb linux builds.
 
* Fixes to DockerFile support.

This release focuses on fixing an issue that could result in address reuse after restarting the application.  If a previously created address was not publically used, it could be returned again after restarting.  This issue has been corrected by always deriving the next address based on the last created one.

A database upgrade has been added to record the additional info needed to fix the above issue.  Due to the database being forwards-compatible only, wallet software can not be reverted to older versions after running a new version.  If a wallet must be reverted back to old software, a seed restore should be performed.

Two new RPCs have been added to this release.  The first is a revoketickets RPC for the JSON-RPC server.  This RPC models the WalletService.RevokeTickets RPC from the gRPC server and its usage is preferable to using rebroadcastmissed, which may be removed at a later time.  The second is a WalletService.GetTransaction RPC for the gRPC server.  This RPC queries the wallet for details regarding a particular transaction using the transaction hash as a lookup key.  Previously, transaction details were only available in the gRPC server by watching block notifications or querying for all transactions in a range of blocks.

### decrediton

This patch release includes quite a few bug fixes as well as revealing more information to the user to avoid situations where the lack of information can lead to confusion.

The Accounts, Send and Receive pages have all received a large revamp to attempt to approach the designers' vision.  There are still some remaining nits to fix, but the far majority of the work has been completed.

The Accounts page now includes a balance overview for each account and that account's properties.  The Send page received the largest change, in that, it no longer has a seperate transaction confirmation view.  Instead, whenever a user completes a output or amount field they are checked for validity and then sent to dcrwallet for tx construction.  With this set up the user can now see the estimated size, fee and total amount in the lower right instead of having to wait until the next page.  Also upon clicking the Send button, the user is shown a passphrase confirmation modal.

Various other small bug fixes and visual tweaks were included in this release as well.
- Revamp Accounts page to be more like the designers' wireframes. Show balances and properties below each.
- Revamp Send functionality to avoid having to show a seperate confirmation page, instead immediately request the transaction to be constructed upon field update then the send button simple shows a passphrase modal to confirm.
- Revamp Receive page to be more like the designers' wireframes.
- Various other visual tweaks as pointed out by the designers.

### dcrd

dcrd changes were primarily infrastructure related (logs) or test related.

# [v1.0.4](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.0.4)

## 2017-06-09

This release contains a fix for an error that caused Paymetheus to be unable to talk to the
dcrwallet process.  Occasionally, HTTP/2 parsing error messages would be displayed and Paymetheus
would need to be closed.  Under certain instances it was possible that the wallet would begin to work
after restarting, but some users continued to hit the issue even after restarting.  The bug was caused
by an integer overflow in the grpc-go version imported by dcrwallet 1.0.3 and was fixed by upgrading
the grpc-go dependency to the latest 1.4.0 release.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.4/decred_1.0.4-release_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.4/decred_1.0.4-release_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

# [v0.8.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.8.1)

## 2017-02-14

This is a patch release to fix bugs related to stakepool usage in Paymetheus:

1. Purchasing tickets for stakepools with the API integration resulted in too low pool fees and this would cause correctly-configured stakepools to never vote with the ticket.
1. Manual stakepool configuration was unusable due to an input validation error that always reset the pool fees value back to zero.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.1/decred_0.8.1-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.1/decred_0.8.1-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

See manifest-paymetheus-v0.8.1.txt for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.

See [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.

## 2017-02-13

This release contains updates and bugfixes to all componenets of Decred.  Some noteable changes include:

1. dcrd contains a demo of hardfork voting for use on testnet.

1. dcrwallet has improvements to the builtin ticketbuyer.  It also has an improved getbalance command.

1. Paymetheus contains the intial stakepool integration.

1. decrediton now works as a self-contained app which does not require a separate download of the command line tools.  It has been updated with an entirely new visual style.  All pages have been updated or revamped so decrediton should now properly handle all basic wallet functions.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decred_0.8.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decred_0.8.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

To install decrediton download, uncompress, and run
[decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decrediton-0.8.0.tar.gz) or
[decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decrediton-0.8.0.dmg).

See manifest-v0.8.0.txt, manifest-paymetheus-v0.8.0.txt,
manifest-decrediton-0.8.0.txt, and manifest-dcrinstaller-v0.8.0.txt
for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.

See [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.

## Notes

As of this release, dcrticketbuyer is no long included.  dcrwallet contains all the automatic ticketbuyer features that the standalone program used to have and should be used instead.

## Known Issues

# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

## 2016-12-26

This release contains bug fixes and improvements for dcrd, dcrwallet,
and Paymetheus.

This includes the first release of decrediton, a new, cross-platform
GUI for decred.  This is not a feature complete version of
decrediton.  Simple operations (creating wallet, importing a seed,
sending and receiving decred) are supported.  This is primarily a demo
of decrediton rather than a production ready tool.  Please try it and
report any issues or additional features you would like on the
[github page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues).  Currently
binaries are only provided for 64 bit Linux and OSX.

Paymetheus has added seed restoration as well as the ability to show
rescan progress.

A new rpc command to resync has been added to dcrwallet.  The
functionality from dcrticketbuyer has been added to dcrwallet.  See
[this commit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/879e0689b539852315b2e311681a6b879fa77f3c)
for details on using the new functionality instead of the seperate
dcrticketbuyer binary.

dcrd has various bugfixes and infrastructure improvements for voting
in a future release.

gominer and copay are unchanged so there are no new binaries for
them.  You should use the previous release for either of them.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

To install decrediton download, uncompress, and run
[decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton-0.7.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
or
[decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton-0.7.0.dmg)

See manifest-v0.7.0.txt, manifest-paymetheus-v0.7.0.txt,
manifest-decrediton-0.7.0.txt, and manifest-dcrinstaller-v0.7.0.txt
for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.

See [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.

# [v0.5.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

## 2016-10-10

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release.

This release contains bugfixes and improvements to all of the decred
tools (dcrd, dcrwallet, gominer, Copay, and Paymetheus).  A new
unified database for tickets and blocks has been added to dcrd.  This
provides significant performance and reliability improvements.
gominer now supports NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.  gominer can now monitor
temperatures and fan speeds on supported AMD or NVIDIA GPUs.  The dcrd
codebase has been modified to track the upstream btcd project more
closely, allowing for easier copying of code between the two projects.
Additional rpc tests have been added to dcrwallet (RFP-10).  All
changes since the last release are listed below.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install a the local Copay GUI download and run
[Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.5.0.dmg)
or
[Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.5.0.zip).

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

See manifest-v0.5.0.txt, manifest-gominer-v0.5.0.txt,
manifest-paymetheus-v0.5.0.txt, and manifest-copay-0.5.0.txt,
manifest--dcrinstaller-v0.5.0.txt for sha256 sums and the associated
.asc files to confirm those shas.

## Notes

The new database will require a full download of the blockchain.  Due
to the speed improvements it will be much quicker than previous
downloads but it is important to be aware that your dcrd will be
unavailable for other operations while this happens.

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

## 2016-09-06

This release contains a variety of bugfixes and improvements to all of
the decred tools (dcrd, dcrwallet, gominer, and Paymetheus).  Desktop
binaries for Copay for OSX and Linux.  Paymetheus is now able to
launch dcrd in the background when it runs.  This is also the first
release built with the version 1.7 of the go compiler.  This produces
smaller and faster binaries than previous versions of go.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install a the local Copay GUI download and run
[Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.4.0.dmg)
or
[Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.4.0.zip).

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

See manifest-v0.4.0.txt, manifest-gominer-v0.4.0.txt,
manifest-paymetheus-v0.4.0.txt, and manifest--dcrinstaller-v0.4.0.txt
for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.

## Known Issues

### Paymetheus

* Spendable balance is incorrect and may even go negative after purchasing tickets. This is only a temporary accounting issue and will resolve itself after the tickets have been mined into a block.

### dcrwallet

* The [WalletService.SpentnessNotifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/blob/master/rpc/documentation/api.md#spentnessnotifications) gRPC API has been intentionally broken to avoid a deadlock situation. The RPC will appear to be working  but no responses will be streamed to the client.

## Notes

### Added stake pool fee functionality:

We have added new config flags for dcrwallet.  Let's go over each
option to make crystal clear its usage:

#### stakepoolcoldextkey

When this option is set it turns on stake pool functionality for
wallet.  When stake pool is enabled for wallet, there are a series of
transaction checks to verify whether this wallet will vote for a
ticket that has used this stake pool's address as the ticketaddress.

This option requires the extended public key of the stake pool's cold
wallet that will receive the pool's fees.  So on simnet for instance
this option looks like this:

```
--stakepoolcoldextkey=spubVWAdividNTiSM9SdLRA5JX6LYNwt58cd51TFnpnULGQ8oqNMNskfkQwU7rjWMCY7phBguVr4XTmAWyDVRKpo2dFyjFb6QG4ihB8w64UPNuu:1000
```

The first portion (spub..., or dpub... on mainnet) is the extended
public key and the second (1000) is the number of addresses to
derive. Every user of the pool gets their own cold fee wallet address
derived, so we recommend using at least 1000 in anticipation of the
relative number of users in the stake pool.

When a vote is created by the stake pool to vote on a ticket that has
been given voting rights, it pays the pool fee to the address derived
for the cold wallet from this extended public key.

#### pooladdress

This is for use by the stake pool user.  It will be an address
provided to the user by the stake pool.  If set, this address is used
during ticket purchase and will commit to a small output in the ticket
that gives the stake pool its required fees.


#### ticketaddress

Same as the old option. This is the address that the stake pool user
is giving the ticket's voting rights to.


#### poolfees

This is the required ticket fee as requested by the stake pool.  The
value set by the user needs to be greater than or equal to that of the
pool.  The fee is a percentage based fee, based on the stake subsidy.
Here is a concrete example from simnet:

The ticket price of this ticket was 46.0551008, and the ticket relay
fees were 0.00000100 per kB. The pool fees were set to 1.00%.  The
subsidy on simnet at this block height is approximately 29.40888 Coins
per vote.  This is the ticket as purchased by the user:

```javascript
"vin": [
	... ,
],
"vout": [
	{
		"value": 46.0551008,
		"n": 0,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"reqSigs": 1,
			"type": "stakesubmission",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYZMHeeixdNRTkk6afzHBPL4unYDsFNd4r"
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 1,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV"
			],
			"commitamt": 0.17948021
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 3,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq"
			],
			"commitamt": 45.87562609
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
```

And here's the vote that the stake pool created for that user's
ticket:

```javascript
"vin": [
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
"vout": [
	{

As you can see '"n": 2,', the third output, is the stake pool fee
of 0.2940888.  This is 1% of the vote reward at that point
(0.2940888/29.40888). The remaining subsidy and the original coins are
returned to the take pool user in output '"n": 3,'. For more
information about stake fees, please refer to
