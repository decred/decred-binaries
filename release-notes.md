# [v0.7.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

## 2016-12-26

This release contains bug fixes and improvements for dcrd, dcrwallet,
and Paymetheus.

This includes the first release of decrediton, a new, cross-platform
GUI for decred.  This is not a feature complete version of
decrediton.  Simple operations (creating wallet, importing a seed,
sending and receiving decred) are supported.  This is primarily a demo
of decrediton rather than a production ready tool.  Please try it and
report any issues or additional features you would like on the
[github page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues).  Currently
binaries are only provided for 64 bit Linux and OSX.

Paymetheus has added seed restoration as well as the ability to show
rescan progress.

A new rpc command to resync has been added to dcrwallet.  The
functionality from dcrticketbuyer has been added to dcrwallet.  See
[this commit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/879e0689b539852315b2e311681a6b879fa77f3c)
for details on using the new functionality instead of the seperate
dcrticketbuyer binary.

dcrd has various bugfixes and infrastructure improvements for voting
in a future release.

gominer and copay are unchanged so there are no new binaries for
them.  You should use the previous release for either of them.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

To install decrediton download, uncompress, and run
[decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton-0.7.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
or
[decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton-0.7.0.dmg)

See manifest-v0.7.0.txt, manifest-paymetheus-v0.7.0.txt,
manifest-decrediton-0.7.0.txt, and manifest-dcrinstaller-v0.7.0.txt
for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.

See [README.md](./README.md) for more info on
verifying the files.

# [v0.5.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

## 2016-10-10

All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release.

This release contains bugfixes and improvements to all of the decred
tools (dcrd, dcrwallet, gominer, Copay, and Paymetheus).  A new
unified database for tickets and blocks has been added to dcrd.  This
provides significant performance and reliability improvements.
gominer now supports NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.  gominer can now monitor
temperatures and fan speeds on supported AMD or NVIDIA GPUs.  The dcrd
codebase has been modified to track the upstream btcd project more
closely, allowing for easier copying of code between the two projects.
Additional rpc tests have been added to dcrwallet (RFP-10).  All
changes since the last release are listed below.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install a the local Copay GUI download and run
[Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.5.0.dmg)
or
[Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.5.0.zip).

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

See manifest-v0.5.0.txt, manifest-gominer-v0.5.0.txt,
manifest-paymetheus-v0.5.0.txt, and manifest-copay-0.5.0.txt,
manifest--dcrinstaller-v0.5.0.txt for sha256 sums and the associated
.asc files to confirm those shas.

## Notes

The new database will require a full download of the blockchain.  Due
to the speed improvements it will be much quicker than previous
downloads but it is important to be aware that your dcrd will be
unavailable for other operations while this happens.

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

## 2016-09-06

This release contains a variety of bugfixes and improvements to all of
the decred tools (dcrd, dcrwallet, gominer, and Paymetheus).  Desktop
binaries for Copay for OSX and Linux.  Paymetheus is now able to
launch dcrd in the background when it runs.  This is also the first
release built with the version 1.7 of the go compiler.  This produces
smaller and faster binaries than previous versions of go.

To install Paymetheus download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install a the local Copay GUI download and run
[Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.4.0.dmg)
or
[Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.4.0.zip).

To install the command line tools, please see
[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).

## Known Issues

### Paymetheus

* Spendable balance is incorrect and may even go negative after purchasing tickets. This is only a temporary accounting issue and will resolve itself after the tickets have been mined into a block.

### dcrwallet

* The [WalletService.SpentnessNotifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/blob/master/rpc/documentation/api.md#spentnessnotifications) gRPC API has been intentionally broken to avoid a deadlock situation. The RPC will appear to be working  but no responses will be streamed to the client.

# [v0.2.0](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

## 2016-07-28

This release contains the initial release of Paymetheus, the Decred
Windows GUI.  To install download and run either
[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.2.0/decred_0.2.0-alpha_x64.msi) or
[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.2.0/decred_0.2.0-alpha_x86.msi)
depending on your version of Windows.

To install the command line tools, please see

This release contains various fixes and improvements, many of which
are required for the new Windows installer and
[GUI](https://github.com/decred/Paymetheus/).  It also includes the
first release of [gominer](https://github.com/decred/gominer/), the
Decred GPU miner with support for stratum pools.  Updated
[ccminer](https://github.com/decred/ccminer) binaries are also
provided.

See manifest-v0.2.0.txt, manifest-dcrinstall-v0.2.0.txt,
manifest-paymetheus-v0.2.0.txt, manifest-gominer-v0.2.0.txt, and
manifest-ccminer-v0.2.0.txt for sha256sums of the packages and
manifest-v0.2.0.txt.asc, manifest-dcrinstall-v0.2.0.txt.asc,
manifest-paymetheus-v0.2.0.txt.asc, manifest-gominer-v0.2.0.txt.asc,

## Notes

### Added stake pool fee functionality:

We have added new config flags for dcrwallet.  Let's go over each
option to make crystal clear its usage:

#### stakepoolcoldextkey

When this option is set it turns on stake pool functionality for
wallet.  When stake pool is enabled for wallet, there are a series of
transaction checks to verify whether this wallet will vote for a
ticket that has used this stake pool's address as the ticketaddress.

This option requires the extended public key of the stake pool's cold
wallet that will receive the pool's fees.  So on simnet for instance
this option looks like this:

```
--stakepoolcoldextkey=spubVWAdividNTiSM9SdLRA5JX6LYNwt58cd51TFnpnULGQ8oqNMNskfkQwU7rjWMCY7phBguVr4XTmAWyDVRKpo2dFyjFb6QG4ihB8w64UPNuu:1000
```

The first portion (spub..., or dpub... on mainnet) is the extended
public key and the second (1000) is the number of addresses to
derive. Every user of the pool gets their own cold fee wallet address
derived, so we recommend using at least 1000 in anticipation of the
relative number of users in the stake pool.

When a vote is created by the stake pool to vote on a ticket that has
been given voting rights, it pays the pool fee to the address derived
for the cold wallet from this extended public key.

#### pooladdress

This is for use by the stake pool user.  It will be an address
provided to the user by the stake pool.  If set, this address is used
during ticket purchase and will commit to a small output in the ticket
that gives the stake pool its required fees.


#### ticketaddress

Same as the old option. This is the address that the stake pool user
is giving the ticket's voting rights to.


#### poolfees

This is the required ticket fee as requested by the stake pool.  The
value set by the user needs to be greater than or equal to that of the
pool.  The fee is a percentage based fee, based on the stake subsidy.
Here is a concrete example from simnet:

The ticket price of this ticket was 46.0551008, and the ticket relay
fees were 0.00000100 per kB. The pool fees were set to 1.00%.  The
subsidy on simnet at this block height is approximately 29.40888 Coins
per vote.  This is the ticket as purchased by the user:

```javascript
"vin": [
	... ,
],
"vout": [
	{
		"value": 46.0551008,
		"n": 0,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"reqSigs": 1,
			"type": "stakesubmission",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYZMHeeixdNRTkk6afzHBPL4unYDsFNd4r"
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 1,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV"
			],
			"commitamt": 0.17948021
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 3,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq"
			],
			"commitamt": 45.87562609
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
```

And here's the vote that the stake pool created for that user's
ticket:

```javascript
"vin": [
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
"vout": [
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
	"value": 0.2940888,
	"n": 2,
	"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "stakegen",
			"addresses": [
				"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV"
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"value": 75.16989347,
		"n": 3,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "stakegen",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq"
			]
		}
	}
]
```

As you can see '"n": 2,', the third output, is the stake pool fee
of 0.2940888.  This is 1% of the vote reward at that point
(0.2940888/29.40888). The remaining subsidy and the original coins are
returned to the take pool user in output '"n": 3,'. For more
information about stake fees, please refer to
dcrwallet/wallet/txrules/doc.go.
