## Notes

### Added stake pool fee functionality:

We have added new config flags for dcrwallet.  Let's go over each
option to make crystal clear its usage:

#### stakepoolcoldextkey

When this option is set it turns on stake pool functionality for
wallet.  When stake pool is enabled for wallet, there are a series of
transaction checks to verify whether this wallet will vote for a
ticket that has used this stake pool's address as the ticketaddress.

This option requires the extended public key of the stake pool's cold
wallet that will receive the pool's fees.  So on simnet for instance
this option looks like this:

```
--stakepoolcoldextkey=spubVWAdividNTiSM9SdLRA5JX6LYNwt58cd51TFnpnULGQ8oqNMNskfkQwU7rjWMCY7phBguVr4XTmAWyDVRKpo2dFyjFb6QG4ihB8w64UPNuu:1000
```

The first portion (spub..., or dpub... on mainnet) is the extended
public key and the second (1000) is the number of addresses to
derive. Every user of the pool gets their own cold fee wallet address
derived, so we recommend using at least 1000 in anticipation of the
relative number of users in the stake pool.

When a vote is created by the stake pool to vote on a ticket that has
been given voting rights, it pays the pool fee to the address derived
for the cold wallet from this extended public key.

#### pooladdress

This is for use by the stake pool user.  It will be an address
provided to the user by the stake pool.  If set, this address is used
during ticket purchase and will commit to a small output in the ticket
that gives the stake pool its required fees.


#### ticketaddress

Same as the old option. This is the address that the stake pool user
is giving the ticket's voting rights to.


#### poolfees

This is the required ticket fee as requested by the stake pool.  The
value set by the user needs to be greater than or equal to that of the
pool.  The fee is a percentage based fee, based on the stake subsidy.
Here is a concrete example from simnet:

The ticket price of this ticket was 46.0551008, and the ticket relay
fees were 0.00000100 per kB. The pool fees were set to 1.00%.  The
subsidy on simnet at this block height is approximately 29.40888 Coins
per vote.  This is the ticket as purchased by the user:

```javascript
"vin": [
	... ,
],
"vout": [
	{
		"value": 46.0551008,
		"n": 0,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"reqSigs": 1,
			"type": "stakesubmission",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYZMHeeixdNRTkk6afzHBPL4unYDsFNd4r"
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 1,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV"
			],
			"commitamt": 0.17948021
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		"value": 0,
		"n": 3,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "sstxcommitment",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq"
			],
			"commitamt": 45.87562609
		}
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
```

And here's the vote that the stake pool created for that user's
ticket:

```javascript
"vin": [
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		... ,
	}
],
"vout": [
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
		... ,
	},
	{
	"value": 0.2940888,
	"n": 2,
	"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "stakegen",
			"addresses": [
				"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV"
			]
		}
	},
	{
		"value": 75.16989347,
		"n": 3,
		"version": 0,
		"scriptPubKey": {
			... ,
			"type": "stakegen",
			"addresses": [
				"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq"
			]
		}
	}
]
```

As you can see '"n": 2,', the third output, is the stake pool fee
of 0.2940888.  This is 1% of the vote reward at that point
(0.2940888/29.40888). The remaining subsidy and the original coins are
returned to the take pool user in output '"n": 3,'. For more
information about stake fees, please refer to
dcrwallet/wallet/txrules/doc.go.
